This is a thin wrapper. The implementation lives in `.cortex/commands/doctor.md`.

1. Run `bash ~/.cortex/core/runtime/command-runner.sh doctor` to validate the command exists in the registry.
   - If it exits non-zero, report the error and stop.
2. Read the file path returned by the runner.
3. Read that file and follow its instructions exactly.

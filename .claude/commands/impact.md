# /impact — Cortex Impact Analysis Engine

## MODE DETECTION

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for flags:
- `--staged` → analyze only staged changes (`git diff --cached`)
- `--deep` → trace transitive dependencies (2nd-degree consumers)
- `--since=<ref>` → analyze changes since a specific commit/branch (e.g., `--since=main`)

Default (no flags): analyze all uncommitted changes (`git diff HEAD`).

---

## STEP 1 — Collect changed files

### Source selection

| Flag | Git command |
|---|---|
| `--staged` | `git diff --cached --name-only` |
| `--since=<ref>` | `git diff <ref>...HEAD --name-only` |
| default | `git diff HEAD --name-only` |

If no changed files are found:
```
[PASS]

No changes detected — nothing to analyze.
```
Stop.

Save the full list as `CHANGED_FILES`.

Also run the matching diff command with `-p` (patch output) and save as `FULL_DIFF`. This is used for content-level analysis in Step 3.

---

## STEP 2 — Classify each changed file

For each file in `CHANGED_FILES`, assign one or more of the following types based on path segments, naming conventions, and file content (read the file to confirm when ambiguous):

| Type | Detection signals |
|---|---|
| `Controller` | path contains `Controller`, `Controllers/`, `api/`, `routes/`; class/function names end in `Controller` or `Handler`; decorators like `@Controller`, `[ApiController]`, `app.get/post` |
| `Service` | path contains `Service`, `Services/`, `Application/`; class names end in `Service` or `Manager`; decorators like `@Injectable`, `@Service` |
| `Repository` | path contains `Repository`, `Repositories/`, `DataAccess/`, `Persistence/`; class names end in `Repository` or `Store`; ORM calls (`DbContext`, `_context.`, `findOne`, `save`) |
| `DTO` | path contains `Dto`, `DTOs/`, `Models/`, `ViewModels/`, `Requests/`, `Responses/`; class/interface is purely data (only properties, no methods) |
| `Configuration` | path contains `appsettings`, `config`, `.env`, `.json` config files, `Program.cs`, `Startup.cs`, `webpack.config`, `tsconfig` |
| `Test` | path contains `Test`, `Tests/`, `Spec`, `__tests__/`, `.spec.`, `.test.` |
| `Hook` | path under `.cortex/core/hooks/` or `.claude/hooks/` |
| `Scanner` | path under `.cortex/core/scanners/` |
| `Registry` | path under `.cortex/registry/` |
| `Schema / Migration` | path contains `Migration`, `Schema`, `.sql`, `prisma/` |

If a file does not match any type: classify as `Unknown`.

Read each file to confirm classification when the path alone is ambiguous. Do not read files that do not belong to `CHANGED_FILES`.

---

## STEP 3 — Trace dependencies

For each changed file, determine what depends on it. Use Grep to find references across the codebase.

Do NOT search inside: `node_modules/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `dist/`, `.git/`, `*.lock`, `*.log`, `*.min.js`, `*.map`.

### By type

**DTO changed**
- Search for the DTO class/interface name across all source files.
- Each file importing or using it is a consumer.
- For each consumer, identify its type (Controller, Service, etc.) and note the dependency.

**Service changed**
- Search for the service class/interface name across all source files.
- Identify all injection points (constructor parameters, DI registrations).
- Trace up to Controllers and other Services that consume it.

**Repository changed**
- Search for the repository class/interface name.
- Identify all Services that inject it.
- From those Services, trace up to Controllers.

**Controller changed**
- Identify all route definitions in the file (e.g., `[HttpGet]`, `app.get(`, `@Get(`).
- Each route is a directly affected endpoint.
- No further upward tracing needed.

**Configuration changed**
- Search for the configuration key names referenced in the changed config.
- Find all source files that read those keys (e.g., `_config["key"]`, `process.env.KEY`, `IOptions<>`).
- Each reading file is a consumer.

**Schema / Migration changed**
- Identify table names from the migration or schema file.
- Search for those table names or corresponding model/entity names across Repositories and Services.

**Hook or Scanner changed** (Cortex-specific)
- No dependency tracing needed — Cortex hooks are event-driven, not imported.
- Note the event they guard and which tool invocations they affect.

**`--deep` mode**: for each consumer found, repeat the dependency trace one level further (find consumers of consumers). Cap at 2 levels of transitive tracing to avoid combinatorial explosion.

Save all traces as: `DEPENDENCY_MAP[file] = { consumers: [], entry_points: [], db_tables: [] }`

---

## STEP 4 — Calculate impact metrics, assign risk level, and generate WHY and FIX

### Metrics

Aggregate across all `DEPENDENCY_MAP` entries:

- **Files changed**: count of `CHANGED_FILES`
- **Services affected**: unique Service-type files in consumers + changed Services
- **Endpoints affected**: count of unique route definitions in changed Controllers + routes in Controllers that consume changed Services or DTOs
- **Layers touched**: set of unique types present in changed files + their consumers (e.g., `{DTO, Service, Controller}` = 3 layers)
- **DB tables affected**: unique table/entity names from Repository and Migration traces

### Risk level

Assign a single `RISK_LEVEL` using this decision table (first matching row wins):

| Condition | Risk |
|---|---|
| Any `Schema / Migration` change | `HIGH` |
| Any `Repository` change with ≥2 Service consumers | `HIGH` |
| Layers touched ≥ 3 | `HIGH` |
| Any `Configuration` change affecting ≥2 consumers | `HIGH` |
| Any `DTO` change with ≥3 consumers | `HIGH` |
| Layers touched == 2 | `MEDIUM` |
| Any `Service` change with ≥1 Controller consumer | `MEDIUM` |
| Any `DTO` change with 1–2 consumers | `MEDIUM` |
| All changes isolated to 1 layer with ≤2 consumers | `LOW` |
| No consumers found for any changed file | `LOW` |

Map risk to status: `HIGH` → `[FAIL]` · `MEDIUM` → `[WARN]` · `LOW` → `[PASS]`

### WHY explanation

Produce a single technical paragraph explaining why the change carries this risk level. Reference specific files changed, specific consumers found, which layers are crossed, and which endpoints or DB tables are affected. No vague statements — every claim must trace back to a file or line found in Steps 2–3.

### FIX recommendation

**If `RISK_LEVEL` is `HIGH`**: identify the specific coupling that elevated the risk and give ONE actionable recommendation (extract a service, split the commit, add an interface layer — pick the most applicable).

**If `RISK_LEVEL` is `MEDIUM`**: "Add or update integration tests covering the `<endpoint>` endpoint before merging — this change propagates through `<ServiceName>` to `<ControllerName>`"

**If `RISK_LEVEL` is `LOW`**: "No structural changes recommended — impact is isolated."

Do NOT provide multiple options. ONE fix only.

## OUTPUT

Print:

```
[PASS | WARN | FAIL]

IMPACT SUMMARY:
  Files changed:      <n>
  Services affected:  <n>
  Endpoints affected: <n>
  Layers touched:     <n> (<list of layer types>)
  DB tables affected: <n> (<list of table names, or "none">)

RISK LEVEL: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH

DETAILS:
```

For each file in `CHANGED_FILES`, print:

```
  File:    <relative/path/to/file>
  Type:    <Controller | Service | Repository | DTO | Configuration | ...>
  Impact:  <what this file affects — specific consumer names and counts>
  Consumers:
    - <consumer file> (<type>)
    - ...
  Endpoints:
    - <METHOD> <route> (in <ControllerFile>)
    - ...
  DB Tables:
    - <table name>
    - ...
```

Then print:

```
WHY:
<single technical paragraph — no vague statements>

FIX:
<single deterministic recommendation>
```

---

## CONSTRAINTS

- Never state a dependency without a Grep result confirming it
- Never claim an endpoint is affected without tracing the call chain
- Never assign HIGH risk based on file count alone — use the risk decision table
- Never output multiple FIX options
- Never include files outside `CHANGED_FILES` in the Files Changed count
